## Contents and Useage

This repository contains Matlab scripts and Latex code to reproduce the figures of the paper. Beforehand, the steps from the [prerequesites section](#prerequisites) have to be performed.

* The directory `proposal` contains the latex code for the extended abstract.
* The directory `paper` contains the latex code for the manuscript (authors version).
* The figures of the video presentation and the paper are stored in `figures`
  * Fig. 1 and Fig. 5 contain robot sketches, generated by `robot_examples.m`
  * Fig. 4 is generated by `statistics_serrob_numops_histogram.m`.
  * The figures for generation times for the serial and parallel robot database of the presentation are generated with `statistics_serrob_cputime_hist_full.m` and `statistics_parroblib.m`.

## Prerequisites <a name="prerequisites">

For the optimization and the figure generation to work, the following repositories have to be downloaded and Matlab has to be installed:
  * [Model Database for Serial Robots](https://github.com/SchapplM/robsynth-serroblib)
  * [Model Database for Parallel Robots](https://github.com/SchapplM/robsynth-parroblib)
  * [Model Database for Hybrid Robots](https://github.com/SchapplM/robsynth-serhybroblib)
  * [External Matlab Dependencies](https://github.com/SchapplM/robotics-dep-ext)
  * [General Robotics Matlab Toolbox](https://github.com/SchapplM/robotics-toolbox)
  * [General Matlab Toolbox](https://github.com/SchapplM/matlab_toolbox)
  * [Toolbox for Model Generation (Proposed in the Paper)](https://github.com/SchapplM/robsynth-modelgen)

After downloading, run the path initialization scripts (`..._path_init.m`) of all downloaded software repos in Matlab.
